This is the script to generate the cost model.
Although, the model that is currently deployed on Azure ML (as of Jan 26, 2016) is one that Stacey had created and passed on to me as a .RDS file.

If you want to go ahead, and create a cost model though, generetCostModel.R is what you would want to use.

If you want to use the one that is currently deployed (the one made by Stacey)
 1.model : cubist_cost_model.RDS
 2.getCostPredictions.R : will query the mode and give cost predictions for some 5 test patients (just for check)
